## What it does 

ParaTools is an app that takes a paragraph as an input and gives you the choice to perform the following functions :

- Convert the **text to audio** so that you can hear how it sounds
- Return a User friendly **summary** of the whole paragraph
  -  You can define what percentage of the paragraph length you want your summary to be
  - The summary is in bulleted form for ease of view
- Provides a **chatbot** that can answer questions related to your paragraph
- Provides a customisable Pie chart to see the most used keywords for better visualization of the topic
